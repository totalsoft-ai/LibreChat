# Team Workspaces – Quick Guide

Collaborate with your team using shared AI agents, prompts, and files — all in one workspace with role-based access control.

---

## What Are Team Workspaces?

**Team Workspaces** are shared environments where teams work together with AI resources.

**Key benefits:**
- Shared resources (files, agents, prompts)
- Clear separation from personal work
- Role-based permissions
- Activity tracking and visibility
- Centralized configuration and cost control

**Modes:**
- **Personal Mode** – Private, only visible to you  
- **Workspace Mode** – Shared with team members

You can switch between modes at any time.

## Workspace Roles

| Role    | Permissions |
|--------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, manage settings, members, models, budgets |
| **Admin** | Manage members, pin resources, configure start page |
| **Member** | Create conversations, share and use resources |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access |

> Most users should be **Members**. Limit **Admins** and **Owner**.
